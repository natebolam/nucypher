Overview
--------

`WorkLock` is a novel, permissionless token distribution mechanism, developed at NuCypher, which requires participants to stake ETH and maintain NuCypher nodes in order to receive NU tokens.

WorkLock offers specific advantages over ICO or airdrop as a distribution mechanism, chiefly: it selects for participants who are most likely to strengthen the network because they commit to staking and running nodes.

The WorkLock begins with an open bidding period, during which anyone seeking to participate can send ETH to the WorkLock contract to be escrowed on-chain.  At the end of the bidding period, stake-locked NU will be distributed pro rata across contributors. If those contributors use that stake-locked NU to run a node, the NU will eventually unlock and their escrowed ETH will be returned in full. Alternatively, WorkLock participants can cancel their bid to forgo NU and recoup their escrowed ETH immediately.

The ``nucypher worklock`` CLI command provides the ability to participate in WorkLock. To better understand the
commands and their options, use the ``--help`` option.

Common CLI flags
----------------

All ``nucypher worklock`` commands share a similar structure:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock <ACTION> [OPTIONS] --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa

TODO

Replace ``<YOUR PROVIDER URI>`` with a valid node web3 node provider string, for example:

    - ``ipc:///home/ubuntu/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc`` - Geth Node on GÃ¶rli testnet running under user ``ubuntu`` (most probably that's what you need).


Show current WorkLock information
---------------------------------

You can obtain information about the current state of WorkLock by running:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock status --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa


If you want to see detailed information about your current bid, you can specify your bidder address with the ``--bidder-address`` flag:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock status --bidder-address <YOUR BIDDER ADDRESS> --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa


Place a bid
-----------

You can place a bid to WorkLock by running:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock bid --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa


Cancel a bid
------------

You can cancel a bid to WorkLock by running:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock cancel-bid --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa


Claim your stake
----------------

If your bid was successful, you can claim your tokens as a stake in NuCypher:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher worklock claim --network <NETWORK> --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa


Once claimed, you can check that the stake was created successfully by running:

.. code::

    (nucypher)$ nucypher status stakers --staking-address <YOUR BIDDER ADDRESS> --network {network} --provider <YOUR PROVIDER URI> --poa
