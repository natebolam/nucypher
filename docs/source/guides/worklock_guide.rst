All ``nucypher worklock`` commands share a similar structure:

TODO

Replace ``<YOUR PROVIDER URI>`` with a valid node web3 node provider string, for example:

    - ``ipc:///home/ubuntu/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc`` - Geth Node on GÃ¶rli testnet running under user ``ubuntu`` (most probably that's what you need).
